Because GitHub doesn t allow me to upload files larger than 25mb, i uploaded the project with low quality assets. 
When you build the app, those must be replaced with high quality assets.
Basically, those .rar files are the HQ assets.

1. Replace the earth textures with those in the archivies.
2. [Optional] Add the background music .wav file to the BackgroundMusic gameobject.

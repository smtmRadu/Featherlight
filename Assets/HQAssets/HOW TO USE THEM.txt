Because github doesn t let me push high size pngs, i serialized everything in this folder as zip files.
After unzip, you, get 1 earth fbx and 3 textures. Do not change any names. Replace old earth assets with the new ones. Set fbx scale factor to 0.01. 
Earth gameobject must have rotation 0,0,0 and scale 100.

GL to not fuck everything up again.


EarthMesh (fbx scale factor = 0.01)
Pos = 0, 0, 2500
Rot = 0, 0, 0
Scale = 100, 100, 100

EarthCollider
Pos = 0, 0, 0
Rot = -17.4, 109.4, -18.8
Scale = 1, 1, 1
